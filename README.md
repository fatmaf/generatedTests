# generatedTests
benchmark tests for all my stuff really. this is the holy grail of tests for my work ? 
if you (another person) wants to get this to work it might be hard.
I'm working on adding a better readme/organising this so that it makes more sense, currently its all over the place 
so enter if you dare. 

## Visualising tests 
This has the python scripts that I used to generate the tests - they are gui based 
These can also be used to visualise the models using the .grid file (which just stores the generated grid in a nice format and does not have anything to do with prism models - future work!)
